				<h3>Interest in computers</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="image right"

						>
					I started coding in 2018 when I was 14 (more on that later). Before
					that, I was an amateur computer user, that is, I knew various things,
					such as Microsoft Office software, Antivirus and Windows installation,
					Theories and history of computers. The reason I studied them was that
					I participated in the Science Olympiad in Computer Science. My
					computer science teacher was a big reason for that. He noticed during
					class that I was gifted in the Paint program. And I knew Paint from my
					1st grade. It was fun for me to draw Marvel heroes on the computer my
					one and only mother in the house bought for the office.
				</p>
				<h3>My first program</h3>
				<p>
					Thus, for the 4th year in a row, I became the regional champion in
					computer science. During this time, programming managed to attract me.
					The kids learning programming at our school got me excited and I wrote
					the code for the first time. The name of the programming language was
					Python. I had tried Pascal and HTML in a simple incomprehensible form
					before, but in Python I felt like a real programmer. The colors in
					VScode, the ease of finding bugs, and most importantly its ease of
					use, completely captivated me. To learn it, I used Eric Metiz's book,
					Let's Learn Python. My first project was
					<a
						href="https://replit.com/@BehruzBerdiyev/X-va-O-oyini#main.py"
						target="_blank"
						>"Tic-Tac-Toe Game"</a
					>. "Excellent, I'm writing code, I know Python perfectly, now?"
				</p>
				<h3>New choice, New career</h3>
				<p>
					Now the
					<a href="https://uzbekcoders.uz/" target="_blank"
						>"OMUC(One Million Uzbek Coders)"</a
					>
					project has come into my life. There I discovered new words for
					myself, such as Front-End, Full-Stack, and here I transferred from
					Python programming to JavaScript programming. Because the demand for
					Python in our region at that time was very low. In my Web Programming
					career, which started with small projects, I completed various
					courses, earned my first income as a freelancer, and more importantly,
					realized that I knew nothing. I still have a lot to learn. I am
					currently working on programming in
					<a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank">NextJS</a>,
					<a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">ReactJS</a>, HTML, CSS
					and
					<a href="#skills">others...</a>
				</p>
				<h3>Curious Behruz</h3>
				<p>
					I also know English and Mathematics. By the way, my
					<a href="./images/ielts-result.pdf" target="_blank">IELTS score</a> is
					5.5 (L: 5.0, R: 5.5, S: 6.0, W: 5.0). However, I am not limited to
					programming. On November 10, 2020, I posted my first programming video
					course on my YouTube channel. So far, I have uploaded 54 videos to my
					channel, reaching 3,547 views and 141 subscribers. The channel was
					renamed
					<a
						href="https://www.youtube.com/curiousbehruz?sub_confirmation=1"
						target="_blank"
						>"Curious Behruz"</a
					>. It was the most appropriate name for me. Also to my channel. There
					I try to cover not only programming but all the topics related to
					technology. So far, full courses in HTML and CSS are available on my
					channel, as well as other minor courses. If I am lucky, I intend to
					expand this list. So, my story is over now, wait for more ...
